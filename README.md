I choose home page(index.html) to add eventlistener, because i found that most users would like to explore home page to find information they need in the usablity test.

Firstly, I add eventlistener to the image of latest live section, which is an essential commercial content and also useful for users. When users click the image of the live show, it would redirect them to the live show page.

Secondly, I add eventlistener to the image of popular musicians section, whcih is a key function of following musicians. when click the image of musician, it would alert users that they have successfully followed the musician.
